# Visitor-Management-System
# 1) Why would you need one?
How many visitors are in the campus right now? How many did your college have yesterday? What about on August 27, 2019?
You probably struggled to answer at least that last question, if not the one before. And if you could answer them at all, you likely had to pull out the binder that holds your visitor sign-in sheets or find the old Excel spreadsheet in your shared drive and manually count the entries. Noye that protection of your employees and workplace is most important.

# 2)While you’ve got that binder open, here are a few more questions for you:
How many of the names can you actually read or were typed incorrectly?
How many visitors don’t have a time noted as to when they arrived?
Who forgot to sign out? (Or are they still hiding somewhere in the campus?)
Was the sign-in or sign-out time that was recorded accurate?
Do you know which staff each visitor met with?

# Now, What is a Visitor Management System?
Visitor management is the process of tracking everyone who enters in building or campus. A visitor may be a student(along with family for campus visit), a delivery person, a job applicant, a contractor, a consultant. Essentially, anyone who is not a regular full-time employee is a visitor. A visitor management system is a technology used to track visitors in a formal way.
